Secured a 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom detached home with 1,800 sq ft, finished basement, and the large lot with greenery they'd been dreaming about. Won their forever home in a competitive situation that most buyers would have walked away from, proving that preparation and strategy trump desperation every time"
